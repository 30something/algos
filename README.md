# Algorithms

This repository contains some custom implementations of difficult (to my mind) algorithms and data structures
written on C++ and related to competetive programming contests and some applied informatics tasks

## Topics (04.2025)

- [Data structures](structures)
  - [Decompositions](decomps)
- [Math tricks](math)
- [Graphs](graphs)
- [Data compression](compression)

## How to run

- Follow the method from .cpp file directly
- [TODO] Add links to related tasks
- [TODO] Add tests for mentioned algorithms
